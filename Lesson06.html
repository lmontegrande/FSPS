            <h2>ST Math Game:</h2>
            <p>In Estimate Fractions on a Number Line players are given a fraction to
              locate on a number line with only the whole numbers labeled. Players move
              a blast pad below the number line to the location of the given fraction.
              If correct, JiJi moves to the location of the fraction and the blast pad
              takes JiJi up off the screen. If the fraction location is incorrect on
              the number line, the blast pad moves off the screen without JiJi. The animation
              shows the interval from 0 to 1 being partitioned into the denominator number
              of equal parts. The animation then shows the unit fraction (one of these
              partitions) being iterated the numerator number of times to determine the
              correct location of that fraction on the number line.</p>

            <p>Project puzzle from Level 2. Students mentally divide a 0 to 1 number
              line to analyze where to place the blast pad indicated by the fraction.
              Project a puzzles from Level 4. Students notice that the denominator defines
              the size of each of JiJi’s jumps and the numerator defines the number of
              jumps JiJi makes. Discuss benchmark and equivalent fractions as strategies

              and comparing fractions to help you place fractions on a number line. Work

            <p>Comparing and ordering fractions and understanding of the relative magnitude
              of numbers develops when students place numbers on a number line and reason
              about their relative size. Creating and using a number line develops an
              understanding of order of numbers. Comparing two points on a number line
              the point to the left is less than the point to the right. Equivalent fractions
              occupy/name the same point on a number line. Using benchmark fractions,
              iteration of unit fractions and equivalence develops an understanding of
              fractions as numbers and reasonableness of answers in operations with fractions.</p>
