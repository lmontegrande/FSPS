            <h2>ST Math Game:</h2>
            <p>In the game, JiJi Cycle Select Basket, players need to get JiJi on the
              balloon basket. Place the basket where JiJi will land and JiJi gets to
              fly up. If the basket is not near enough to where JiJi lands, the balloons
              go up without JiJi and players need to try again. The JiJi cycle rolls
              to the right for the blue wheels and fraction of a wheel and to the left
              for red wheels or fraction of a wheel. The game connects a circle model
              of fractions to a linear, number line model. The game also builds a visual
              understanding of adding and subtracting fractions in an estimation context.</p>

            <h4>Common Core Content Standards</h4>
            <p class="ts-large">Extend understanding of fraction equivalence and ordering.</p>
            <p>
              <b>4.NF.A.1</b>Explain why a fraction a/b is equivalent to a fraction (n
              × a)/(n × b) by using visual fraction models, with attention to how the
              number and size of the parts differ even though the two fractions themselves
              are the same size. Use this principle to recognize and generate equivalent
              fractions.</p>
            <p class="ts-large">Build fractions from unit fractions by applying and extending previous
              understandings of operations on whole numbers.</p>
            <p>
              <b>4.NF.B.3</b>Understand a fraction a/b with a &gt; 1 as a sum of fractions
              1/b.</p>
            <p>
              <b>4.NF.B.3.a</b>Understand addition and subtraction of fractions as joining
              and separating parts referring to the same whole.</p>
            <p class="ts-large">Use equivalent fractions as a strategy to add and subtract fractions.</p>
            <p>
              <b>5.NF.1</b>Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators (including
              mixed numbers) by replacing given fractions with equivalent fractions in
              such a way as to produce an equivalent sum or difference of fractions with
              like denominators. For example, ⅔ + 5/4 = 8/12 + 15/12 = 23/12. (In general,
              a/b + c/d = (ad + bc)/bd.)</p>

            <h2>Fraction Schema:</h2>
            <p>On a number line the unit whole is defined by the distance from 0 to 1.
              The number line can then be successively partitioned into units of the
              same distance. All numbers on the number line are positioned relative to
              that distance. The distance between units can then be partitioned repeatedly
              into any number of equal measures. Successive partitioning on the number
              line can lead to understanding of equivalent fractions as numbers that
              occupy the same point on the number line. Addition and subtraction can
              be shown on a number line as successive jumps in the same direction (addition)
              or a jump in the opposite direction (subtraction). Finding the location
              of an operation with jumps of different units (e.g. halves and thirds)
              is facilitated by partitioning each unit into an equivalent unit, e.g.
              halves are partitioned by three sections and thirds by two sections resulting
              in both having sixths as their unit.</p>

                line? Would that have helped you solve this problem? Why or why not?</li>

              the strategies described below. Your students will vary in the language
              they use.</p>
            <h4>What sequence of strategies do you intend to use?</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Show an example of a misconception such as students who added 4 jumps
                to 5/4 without partitioning the number line to make accurate jumps. Have
                students identify the misconceptions.</li>
              <li>Students create a number line and show 5/4 as a jump on the number line.
                They rename 5/4 as 15/12. They partition the number line to the right of
                5/4 into twelfths. They count over 16/12 Discuss what each jump/move represents
                in the problem.</li>
              <li>Have one or two students share how they solved the problem and represented
                it on the number line. Discuss and compare the jumps on the number line
                to the equations.
                <ul>
                  <li>“I made my number line in fourths. Then I made 5 jumps of ¼ to plot 5/4.
                    I knew I had to make twelfths to add thirds and fourths so I divided the
                    fourths into 3 equal parts and that made twelfths. 5/4 was the same as
                    15/12. I counted over 16/12 which is 4/3 to the right. I landed on 21/12,
                    because 15 + 16 = 21. ”</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Students understand that if a number is at the same location as another
                number on a number line, the two numbers are equivalent.</li>

                yet represent the same number.</li>
              <li>Students make connections between the jumps on a number line and expressions
                and equations. Connect back to the JiJi puzzles.
                <ul>
                  <li>When I jump to the right 3 jumps of ¼, it is the same as 3 ¼.</li>
                </ul>

              <li>Students understand how the number line jumps represent addition</li>
              <li>Students understand why they need to find a common denominator for fractions
                in order to add or subtract them.</li>
              <li>Students partition a number line several times in order to find a measure
                that allows them to name a point as accurately as possible. Then they connect
                this idea to the concept of creating common denominators.</li>
