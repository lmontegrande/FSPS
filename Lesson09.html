            <h2>ST Math Game:</h2>
            <p>In the game, JiJi Cycle Select Basket, players need to get JiJi on the
              balloon basket. Place the basket where JiJi will land and JiJi gets to
              fly up. If the basket is not near enough to where JiJi lands, the balloons
              go up without JiJi and players need to try again. The JiJi cycle rolls
              to the right for the blue wheels and fraction of a wheel and to the left
              for red wheels or fraction of a wheel. The game connects a circle model
              of fractions to a linear, number line model. The game also builds a visual
              understanding of adding and subtracting fractions in an estimation context.</p>

            <h2>Fraction Schema:</h2>
            <p>On a number line the unit whole is defined by the distance from 0 to 1.
              The number line can then be successively partitioned into units of the
              same distance. All numbers on the number line are positioned relative to
              that distance. The distance between units can then be partitioned repeatedly
              into any number of equal measures. Successive partitioning on the number
              line can lead to understanding of equivalent fractions as numbers that
              occupy the same point on the number line. Addition and subtraction can
              be shown on a number line as successive jumps in the same direction (addition)
              or a jump in the opposite direction (subtraction). Finding the location
              of an operation with jumps of different units (e.g. halves and thirds)
              is facilitated by partitioning each unit into an equivalent unit, e.g.
              halves are partitioned by three sections and thirds by two sections resulting
              in both having sixths as their unit.</p>
