                      <h2>What are schemas?</h2>

                      <p>Schemas are neural networks that form a cognitive framework for how we perceive and
                      interact with the world around us. Students start school with their own informal
                      mathematical schemas. Taking these schemas into account and providing rich problem solving
                      tasks and classroom discussions help students apply and extend prior knowledge while
                      confronting and resolving possible errors and misconceptions. The tasks in this course are
                      designed to activate student schemas around whole numbers, partitioning and equal shares,
                      and the meaning of the four operations to support students’ solid construction of fraction
                      schemas. Below are some key aspects of these schemas students will be developing as you
                      engage them in the rich problem-solving tasks found in this course.</p>

                      <h2>Connecting to Existing Schemas</h2>

                      <h4>Whole Numbers and Units</h4>

                      <p>Everything needed for a student’s initial study of fractions is already in 
                      place with whole numbers. At the core of this schema are the concepts of ‘Quantity,’ 
                      ‘Counting’ and ‘Number.‘ Long before they learn number names or symbols (Number) or how 
                      to use the counting sequence (Counting), students as infants have a sense of quantity.  
                      They have the concept of more/less and can subitize (visually recognize sets) up to 5 objects. 
                      Fractions are numbers and students need to see them as a natural extension of their number schema.<br />
                      Through early elementary grades students develop a formal understanding of whole numbers based on 
                      working with 1. This unit, “1 whole,” is at the core of the whole number schema. As students learn to 
                      count, they generate the next number by counting ‘1’ more. All whole numbers can be modeled and understood 
                      as being composed of a set of ‘1 whole’ units. Early work with addition and subtraction involves counting 
                      on or counting back by ones.</p>

                      <div class="row mrg-small">
                          <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: center">

                          </div>
                      </div>

                      <p>The idea of a counting unit is expanded through place value experiences to apply to
                      units other than one whole: “1-ten” or “1-hundred.” The whole number schema now extends to
                      incorporate place value and an understanding of different ‘units:’ e.g., 345 = 300 + 40 + 5
                      = (3x100)+(4x10)+(5x1) = 3 hundreds + 4 tens + 5 ones.</p>

                      <h4>Unit Fractions</h4>

                      <p>Prior to formal introduction of fraction notation (e.g. 2/3), students should experience 
                      fractions as an extension of whole numbers by having to name unit fractions in contexts that 
                      describe ‘how much/many?’, e.g. I shared 5 apples with my brother and I get 2 and 1 half. This 
                      will support an interpretation of  the denominator as naming the type of unit we are working 
                      with rather than as a separate quantity or number. Students begin to make the 
                      connections between the unit ‘whole’ and unit fractions, (e.g.,’1-fourth’). Unit fractions like ½ 
                      (1-half) or ¼ (1-fourth) behave the same way as whole number
                      units, (e.g. 1-whole, 1-ten or 1-hundred). We can count them (e.g., ½ , 2/2, 3/2, 4/2), describe quantities in 
                      terms of them (e.g. I have 3 halves), and
                      understand other fractions as composed of unit fractions (e.g. , 6/2 is 6-halves or later as 6/2 = ½ + ½ + ½ + ½ + ½ + ½.)
                      Understanding fractions as numbers requires experiences that necessitate the need for new units, units between whole 
                      numbers. Fair sharing tasks that involve mixed numbers (e.g. 5 lemon bars shared among 2 friends) are an effective way 
                      to begin to build this understanding in a problem solving context.</p>

                      <h4>Partitioning and Equal Shares</h4>

                      <div class="row mrg-small">
                          <div class="col-md-8">
                              <p>Students come to school with a foundation of sharing items fairly. This fair
                              shares understanding progresses to partitioning unit wholes into equal shares.
                              The problem type tasks in this manual provide an initial opportunity for students to
                              partition and name the fair shares using unit fraction names. Building strong fraction 
                              schemas involves engaging students with these experiences prior to introducing formal 
                              notation and vocabulary of numerator/denominator or shading pre-partitioned shapes. 
                              Build on students’ informal language to connect to formal language and symbols. Labeling 
                              the unit fraction by naming the kind of unit prior to formal notation helps build this 
                              understanding, e.g. 1-third vs ⅓.</p>
                              <p>
                                  For example: 3 kids share 7 chocolates<br />
                                  S: Each kid gets 2 chocolates and a part of another.<br />
                                  T: How many of these parts would make a whole chocolate?<br />
                                  S: Three<br />
                                  T: We can all this part ‘a third’ because you need 3 to make a whole.<br />
                              </p>

                              <p>Textbooks tend to present students the same conventional partitions 
                              repeatedly during the course of the unit. It is important to engage 
                              students to actively partition shapes into many different areas. 
                              Extending students’ equal shares schema to include non-congruent areas 
                              that represent equal shares provides a foundation for understanding 
                              equivalence. In example A),  while the fourths are non-congruent, they 
                              are equal shares of the same whole square. If these were candy bars of 
                              the same size, the amount shared for each person would be the same 
                              regardless of the shape of the one-fourth share.</p>

                              <p>In example B), partitioning the large rectangle into different sized 
                              areas provides opportunities for students to determine the unit value of 
                              each fractional area by thinking multiplicatively. Students begin to ‘see’ 
                              equivalence among the fractions, i.e. different ways to name the same area, 
                              by visualizing how 4 of the small yellow squares fit into the larger orange 
                              square. By iterating the partition up to the whole, e.g. it takes 4 of these 
                              pink rectangles to make the whole rectangle, students  connect concepts 
                              learned earlier about naming unit fractions to working with equivalence.</p>

                      <p>These tasks also help students see that fractions define two ‘units’, the ‘unit whole’ 
                      and the ‘unit’ fraction. When the ‘unit whole’ is defined it can be partitioned into equal 
                      shares or equal intervals on a number line.  One partition describes a ‘unit’ fraction. 
                      The number of ‘unit-fractions’ needed to compose a ‘unit-whole’ names the fraction, i.e. 
                      defines the denominator in the  fraction. </p>

                      <p>Experiences with visual comparisons progress to symbolically comparing fractions with
                      like denominators and focus on counting the number of equal partitions. Then move to
                      comparing fractions with the same numerator. The size of the partitions have an inverse
                      relationship to the number of equal partitions (e.g., 1/16 &lt; &#x2153;). Students’
                      understanding of comparing and ordering fractions build upon their understanding of
                      equivalence and the relationships between the numerator and denominator.</p>

                      <h4>Number lines</h4>

                      <p>An important aspect of the schema is understanding unit fractions represent numbers on a
                      number line. In the number line model the location of unit fractions is determined by the
                      distance of the interval from 0 to 1.</p>

                      <p>Models, such as number lines, support the construction of visual schemas which form a
                      foundation for developing understanding about whole numbers, place value and the four
                      arithmetic operations. The number line shows the iteration of a ‘unit’ to generate the next
                      number in the sequence. All real numbers are relative amounts in comparison to the interval
                      0 to 1. Being able to ‘see’ consecutive whole numbers as equidistant points on a number
                      line sets the stage for understanding that other numbers/points exist between whole
                      numbers.</p>

                      <div class="row mrg-small">
                          <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: center">
                            <img class="img-responsive ims-large" src="img/Intro/Building00005.png">
                          </div>
                      </div>

                      <p>Number lines are an example of fractions as measures. The unit whole is defined as the
                      distance from 0 to 1. The number line can then be successively partitioned into units of
                      the same distance. All numbers on the number line are positioned relative to that distance.
                      The distance between units can then be partitioned into any number of distances of equal
                      measures.</p>

                      <div class="row mrg-small">
                          <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: center">
                            <img class="img-responsive ims-large" src="img/Intro/Building00006.png">
                          </div>
                      </div>

                      <p>Any distance on a number line can be divided into smaller equal partitions. Successive
                      partitioning of any interval such as successive halving of the interval from ¼ to ½ will
                      create infinite number of a/b fractions. This is an example of the density property of
                      rational numbers.</p>

                      <h4>Four Operations</h4>

                      <p>The four operations expand and strengthen whole number schemas as students experience
                      combining, separating, creating equal groups and partitioning objects into equal shares.
                      Addition and subtraction, as joining or separating actions, build on counting schema and
                      can be reinforced with number line models. Multiplication and division schemas build on
                      grouping and sharing actions and can be reinforced with area models. Understanding whole
                      number operations is extended to operations with rational numbers.</p>

                      <p>Multiplication and division play a particularly important role in supporting fraction
                      schemas. These operations represent the heart of multiplicative reasoning, the ability to
                      think relationally and proportionally through iterating units. Multiplicative reasoning is
                      further developed when students understand a/b = a × 1/b or a/b = a ÷ b. Multiplicative
                      reasoning is at the heart of understanding fractions and all rational numbers. Lesson 6,
                      Alphabet City task involves understanding multiplicative relationships between part-part
                      and part-whole. Students determine an area is ¼ of the whole area and realize that ¼ is
                      partitioned into 2 areas and understand the area of each partition is ⅛ of the whole.</p>

                      <p>Engaging students in problem-solving tasks that activate these two schemas: 1-Number
                      Schema: using a ‘unit’ to count and answer ‘how many’ questions, and 2-Operation Schema:
                      operating on quantities to solve real world situations, support student understanding of
                      fractions as a natural extension of their prior knowledge. Before introducing the symbols
                      and vocabulary of numerator and denominators, students need to leverage their experiences
                      with counting and fair sharing to build a formal understanding of their intuitive sense of
                      halves, thirds, fourths, etc, and how they can be operated upon to solve real world
                      problems.</p>

                      <h4>Miscellaneous Ideas</h4>
                      <p>introduce a new concept by providing students with opportunities to grapple with novel 
                      problems and challenging mathematical tasksbefore teaching specific formulas or procedures</p>
