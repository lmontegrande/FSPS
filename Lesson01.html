            <h6>Fraction Schema:</h6>
            <p>Fractions extend and build upon whole number schemas. Multiplication and
              division situations support this connection by providing students with
              the opportunity to apply multiplicative reasoning in situations that require
              partitioning ‘whole’ quantities into unit fractions in order to answer
              the question ‘how many’ with precision. Engaging students in problem solving
              contexts helps build an understanding of fractions as numbers in ways that
              they can understand and make sense of.</p>

            <h2>Anticipated Student Responses: How might students express their thinking?</h2>
            <h4>Task 1: ST Math Fair Share puzzles</h4>
            <p>Students model the puzzle and solve the question, ‘Where should the path
              be so it is at the height of the blocks when they are shared equally among
              each animal?’</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Direct Modeling:</b>&nbsp;student uses cubes or drawings to represent
                all the blocks in the problem then distributes the blocks to each animal.
                the distribution may be 1 block at a time or more efficiently by realizing
                that the creatures can get more than 1 block.</li>
              <li>
                <b>Counting:</b>&nbsp;Student counts out the block each animal gets until
                the total number of blocks are used up. E.g. “9 blocks and 3 frogs: each
                frog gets 1, that’s 3; another block makes 6; another (3rd) makes 9. Each
                frog gets three blocks. Or student skip counts: 3, 6, 9 and understands
                each ‘count’ to be a block for all three frogs.”</li>
              <li>
                <b>Derived Fact/Relational Thinking:</b>&nbsp;Student looks at relationship
                between animals and total blocks, e.g. “3 frogs and 9 blocks. How many
                blocks for each frog? 3 times what is 9? 3 × 3 = 9. Each frog gets 3 blocks.”</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Task 2: Fair Sharing Problem</h4>
            <p>Students develop strategies for sharing lemon bars among friends that
              involve partitioning whole bars into equal shares. While there is only
              1 solution for the problem, there are multiple strategies to find the solution.</p>

                    be shared and distributes it to each friend. When they don’t have enough
                    lemon bars for each friend to get a ‘whole’ bar they partition the bar
                    into equal shares, most likely in halves, without thinking about how many
                    halves that would make or how they relate to the number of friends sharing
                    the pieces.</li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Additive Coordination:</b>&nbsp;Student represents the bars needing to
                    be ‘split’ and cuts them based on how many friends are sharing them. If
                    two bars are shared among 4 friends, they may cut the first one into fourths
                    and give each friend one piece, then do the same with the second bar.</li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Relational Thinking:</b>&nbsp;Student realizes the four kids sharing the
                    two bars can be solved by giving two friends one lemon bar each (i.e. seeing
                    a simpler ratio or using a common factor to make the problem easier.) Then
                    each friend gets half a bar.</li>
