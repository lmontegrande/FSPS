            <h2>Fraction Schema:</h2>
            <p>Student misconceptions of fractions are frequently promoted and reinforced
              by static models of fractions, e.g. squares or circles partitioned in the
              same way where the total number of partitions marks the denominator and
              the ‘shaded’ partitions call out the numerator. This lesson engages students
              in constructing an understanding of unit fractions by creatively partitioning
              a unit square in several different ways and then constructing proofs of
              two key concepts for understanding fractions: 1. How noncongruent shapes
              can represent the same unit fraction, and 2. The importance of using the
              same unit whole when making comparisons.</p>

                      <li>Some students may also cut each square or non-square rectangle in half,

                  <li>
                    <b>Move the Lines:</b>&nbsp;On a geoboard or drawing, students will cut two

                    band and remove the original partition to create four congruent areas.
                    Proving why this works mathematically is very challenging and many students
                    will struggle. Encourage students to use another strategy to try to prove
