            <h2>ST Math Game:</h2>
            <p>Unit Multiplications on a NL asks the player to place the blast pad on
              the number line so that when the fraction is multiplied by a whole number,
              the fraction is placed on the number line and then iterated the given whole
              number of times. When a whole number is multiplied by a fraction, the whole
              number is placed on the number line and then divided into the same number
              of sections as the denominator of the fraction. The numerator is the number
              of the sections taken.</p>

            <p draggable="true">An understanding of partitioning the unit whole on a number line and iterating

              Relating whole number multiplication to multiplication of a whole number

              multiplication problem. Modeling multiplication of a fraction by a whole
              number on a number line facilitates an understanding of why multiplication
