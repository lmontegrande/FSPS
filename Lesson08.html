            <p>In Bricks, players need to place one or more colored shapes into the area
              of an ‘empty’ shape in the center of the puzzle. When players click and
              place pieces that fill the shape exactly, JiJi will cross the screen. If
              the shapes do not fit exactly, the overlapping sections drop and block
              JiJi’s path. All the shapes have a proportional relationship to each other.
              They have either equivalent areas but are not congruent shapes or are a
              fraction (½ or ¼) of the area of all the other shapes.</p>

              of the partitions develops an understanding of the relative size of fractions
              (e.g., ½ of ¼ is ⅛). Actively manipulating the partitions within a shape
              provides students with an understanding of the relative size of partitions
              and proof that two non-congruent shapes can have the same area and have
              the same fractional relationship to the whole shape. Finding the size of
              a fractional part of a fractional part leads to understanding multiplication
              of a fraction by a fraction. Iterating fractional parts to find the whole
              involves going from the part to the whole or multiplicative reasoning (reasoning
              up).</p>

            <h4>What student strategies will support the lesson’s math goals?</h4>
            <p>The sequence below is one example. You’re students may not have used all
              the strategies described below. Your students will vary in the language
              they use.</p>
            <h4>What sequence of strategies do you intend to use?</h4>
            <ol>

                of one of the playground areas. The following is a possible sequence of
                sharing:
                <ol type="a" draggable="true">
                  <li>Students cut out all of the playground areas and find out how many it
                    takes to fill the whole city. This shows iterating a unit fraction. Help
                    the student represent this thinking with an equation.</li>
                  <li>Students fold or cut out the size of the whole city to find the size of
                    the playground areas.</li>
                  <li>Students reason about the size of the playground areas in their heads
                    and compare different playground area sizes by halving. Discuss with the
                    student how they can represent this thinking with an equation.</li>
                  <li>Students represent the relationship of the playground areas with equations.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Share a misconception such as the total for all of their playground areas
                does not add up to one or how the taxes were determined incorrectly. Students
                identify the misconceptions.</li>
              <li>Have several students share how they determined the size of the playground
                areas.
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>“I started with the A and B lots and knew they were 14 the area of the
                    whole city . Then I knew that A was half of that so it was 18 the area
                    of the whole city. B was the same size.”</li>
                  <li>“I knew that E, F and G were ¼ the area of the whole city. F was half
                    of that so it was ⅛ the area of the whole city. E and G were both half
                    the size of F so they were ½ of ⅛ which is 1/16.”</li>

                area.</li>
              <li>Students understand that a playground area sized 1/b is one part when
                the whole playground is partitioned into b equal parts.</li>
              <li>Students understand that it takes b playground areas of size 1/b to make
                the whole playground.</li>
              <li>Students explain and justify how they use halving to help them determine
                the size of the playground areas.</li>
              <li>Students describe why areas that are the same fractional size of a whole
                do not have to be the same shape (non-congruent).</li>
              <li>Students understand that when they add up the fractional size of all parts
                of a whole area, they will get 1. (This is a very important concept that
                may reveal gaps in students' schemas.)</li>
              <li>Students understand that ½ of ½ is ¼ and ½ of ¼ is ⅛? If appropriate ask
