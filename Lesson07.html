            <h2>ST Math Game:</h2>
            <p>In Fraction of Shape, students enter the value of the numerator that represents
              the pieces colored in the visual model. The fraction animates to create
              the visual model used in the prompt. When correct the colored pieces fill
              in the shaded sections, when incorrect the mismatched pieces fall to the
              ground and block JiJi’s path. The use of unconventional partitions in this
              game (see above) and the accompanying animation provide an opportunity
              for students to visually identify different unit fractions to describe
              how the visual model can been partitioned equally.</p>

            <h4>Task 1: Present ST Math puzzles:</h4>
            <p>Project a puzzle from level 3 that uses an equilateral triangle partitioned
              into sixths (trapezoids) or eighths (triangles). Ask students to solve
              the given puzzle and describe how the animation defines the role of a denominator
              and numerator in this context. Have students use available materials (see
              lesson below) to find equivalent ways to describe and justify what fraction
              of the shape is colored.</p>
            <h4>Task 2: Tangram problem:</h4>
            <p>After making tangrams with the students (see appendix B), challenge students
              to identify what fraction of the original square each piece represents.
              Cooperative groups work well with this task. (Option: read
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Warlord’s Puzzle</span>by Virginia Pilegard.) Compare different strategies

            <h2>Fraction Schema:</h2>
            <p>Students develop a deeper understanding of unit fractions and equivalence
              using area models by working with a ‘whole’ that has been partitioned into
              areas of different, but related, sizes. They develop multiplicative reasoning
              to derive the fractional value of each shape by identifying equivalent
              relationships among different shapes, e.g. “If 2 medium triangles make
              a large triangle and 4 large triangles make the whole square, then it takes
              8 medium triangles to make the whole square. That means the medium triangle
              must be ⅛ of the whole square.” Students construct an understanding of
              unit fractions and equivalence by composing and decomposing the ‘whole’
              and it’s fractional parts. They compose the whole, e.g. “it takes four
              of this large triangles to make the whole, so it must be ¼ and since it
              takes 2 of this medium triangle to make a large, then it must be ⅛,l” and
              decompose it, “e.g. cutting the square into four equal triangles makes
              each of these triangles ¼.”</p>

                    creating the ‘whole’ square using four triangles. Then he builds the whole
                    square using eight medium triangles and identifies them as eighths. There
                    are not enough of the smallest triangles (1/16ths) within a group to build
                    the whole square.</li>
                  <li>Reason Multiplicatively: Student takes one large triangle and iterates
                    it four times mentally or physically without using 4 triangles. Once these
                    triangles are labeled, student places medium triangle on top of large triangle
                    and notices that this is half of the large triangle. She reasons that if

                    take eight to make the whole square and label it ⅛. This approach can be
