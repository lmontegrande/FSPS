            <h2>ST Math Game:</h2>
            <p>In Fruit Monster, feeding the monsters the correct amount of food makes
              them go away and lets JiJi cross. Each puzzle gives you how much one monster
              eats (unit rate) and either the number of monsters needing to be fed or
              the amount of fruit you have to feed the monsters. Changing what is known
              and unknown in the puzzles allows students to develop strategic reasoning
              and a schema for understanding the relationship between multiplication
              and division: Monsters × Fruit/Monster = Total Fruit.</p>

            <h6>Fraction Schema:</h6>
            <p>Unit fractions (
              <sup>1</sup>⁄
              <sub>b</sub>) play a key role in connecting fractions to whole numbers and
              providing a conceptual foundation for later work with rational numbers.
              In the dog food problem, unit fractions provide a basis for counting units
              of the size
              <sup>1</sup>⁄
              <sub>b</sub>, e.g. 1-half, 2-halves, 3-halves. This connects to the notation
              we use for fractions a/b--&gt;
              <sup>1</sup>⁄
              <sub>2</sub>&nbsp;
              <sup>2</sup>⁄
              <sub>2</sub>&nbsp;

              <sub>2</sub>&nbsp;
              <sup>4</sup>⁄
              <sub>2</sub>&nbsp; and supports understanding that fractions
              <sup>a</sup>⁄
              <sub>b</sub>&nbsp; are formed by "a" parts of the size "
              <sup>1</sup>⁄
              <sub>b</sub>." This iteration builds an understanding that
              <sup>a</sup>⁄
              <sub>b</sub>&nbsp; = a x
              <sup>1</sup>⁄
              <sub>b</sub>&nbsp; which students will use in 4th grade. The task also provides
              an opportunity to understand that when a is a multiple of b, we can write
              that fraction as a whole number. They demonstrate the multiplicative relationship
              between the number of sharers (e.g. number of days to feed Mandy) and size
              of each share(e.g. serving size of dog food per day). If Mandy is fed
              <sup>1</sup>⁄
              <sub>2</sub>&nbsp; cup of her special dog food for 8 days, I will need 4 cups
              of Mandy’s special dog food. Students create a fraction ab (
              <sup>8</sup>⁄
              <sub>2</sub>) as the quantity formed by “a” (8) parts of size “
              <sup>1</sup>⁄
              <sub>b</sub>” (
              <sup>1</sup>⁄
