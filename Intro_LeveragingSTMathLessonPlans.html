                      <h2>Continuum of Understandings</h2>

                      <p>The focus of the fraction lessons and problem solving tasks is to promote both the 
                      development of students’ mathematical reasoning about fractions over time and to provide 
                      a window into their mathematical thinking. These lessons provide a continuum of learning 
                      experiences and standards which build upon each other and are accessible for all students. 
                      The fraction lesson plans may be viewed as a possible roadmap of how to meet the needs of 
                      all students based on their initial understanding and to foster their continuous growth. 
                      This requires understanding the previous, current and future grade level standards.  </p>

                      <p>Our lessons provide a variety of problem solving experiences to foster students’ 
                      understanding of fractions. When students solve equal sharing and multiple groups problems 
                      they encounter the need to partition 1-whole and identify equal size units  less than 1-whole. 
                      Multiplication and division problem types differ in the location of the unknown.  Both area 
                      and number line diagrams provide visual representations of how fractions relate to whole 
                      numbers. Area models create opportunities for students to partition whole units into smaller 
                      equal size units and identify the size of the smaller partitions. Number line models show a 
                      linear model for students to view fractions as measures. This visual representation shows 
                      students how they can partition and/or iterate any size unit to form a number line. Students 
                      develop an understanding of the relative magnitude of numbers when they create their own 
                      number lines and identify points on it.</p>

                      <h2>Lesson Sequence and Rationale</h2>

                      <p>Solving word problems with whole numbers is the foundation for solving word problems with 
                      fractional amounts. Students have greater access to multiplication, partitive and measurement 
                      division problem types with actions because the action can be directly modeled.  Students come 
                      to school with prior experiences of sharing. These experiences provide a starting point for 
                      students to identify the dealing action in partitive division problems.  Lesson 1 “Lemon Bars” 
                      is a partitive division problem. In partitive division word problems the action is “dealing 
                      out’ equal shares to a specified number of groups to determine the size of each group. </p>

                      <p>In multiplication problem types we know the number of groups (e.g., 8 days) and the size of 
                      each group (e.g., 12cup of dog food for each day) and we want to solve for the total amount. 
                      Lesson 2, “Mandy’s Special Dog Food” involves the action of Mandy receiving an equal amount of 
                      dog food each day (e.g.,12cup ) for a specified number of days (e.g., 8 days).The question to 
                      be answered is how much dog food I need to buy to have enough dog food for the entire 8 days I 
                      am on vacation.</p>

                      <p>In Lesson 3, “How Many Ways” students partition congruent squares into fourths in as many 
                      unique ways as they can. Students investigate fourths of the same size whole and determine they 
                      do not have to be congruent.  (e.g., The whole square could be partitioned into 4 smaller 
                      squares of equal size or 4 triangles of equal size).   Students prove that all of the  
                      partitions within and across (e.g., one of the triangles and one of the squares) the squares 
                      have the same area and are equivalent. </p>

                      <p>Number lines are an important tool/representation to help students understand fractions as 
                      numbers, compare and order fractions, and operate with fractions.  A fraction, like all real 
                      numbers is a directed location (direction and distance from 0) on the number line. In Lesson 4, 
                      “Scale Fractions on a Number Line” students build a number line using a bar model of a given 
                      number by iterating the fraction bar (e.g., 1/2, 1/4, and/or 1/3) and/or the whole bar to plot 
                      points on the number line. Building the number line helps students understand the relative 
                      magnitude of numbers including fractions.</p>

                      <p>Multiplication (e.g.,“Mandy”) and partitive division (e.g., “Lemon Bars”) problem types 
                      provide students with greater access to measurement division problem types. Lesson 5 “Feeding 
                      Brody” is an example of a measurement division problem situation. The action in measurement 
                      division problems is ‘measuring out’ a specified amount to each group and the unknown is the 
                      number of groups. In the “Feeding Brody” problem we know the total amount of dog food left for 
                      Brody and the amount of dog food he is fed each day. We need to determine how many days his dog 
                      food will last. Measurement division problems with tenths and hundredths reinforce students’ 
                      comprehension of place value in our base-ten number system.</p>

                      <p>In Lesson 6, “Estimating Fractions on a Number Line” students are given several fractions 
                      which they place on a number line they create.  Placement of fractions on a number line provides 
                      an opportunity for students to compare the relative magnitude of numbers. Students will use 
                      benchmark fractions and equivalent fractions, including fractions that equal whole numbers, to 
                      help them reason about placement of the fractions on the number line.</p>

                      <p>Students first experience fractions as equal, congruent (same size and same shape) partitions 
                      of a shape. In Lesson 7, “The Broken Tile” students actively partition a whole into noncongruent 
                      areas and determine the fraction of the whole each piece represents. They discover that 
                      noncongruent shapes may represent the same fractional portion of the whole area.  It would take 
                      the same number of equal sized pieces to cover the whole shape (e.g., a triangle that is &frac14;th 
                      of the whole and a rectangle that is &frac14;th of the whole would each take four of the shapes to 
                      cover the same area as the whole).</p>

                      <p>In Lesson 8, “Playground Areas” students may apply their experience with “Broken Tiles” to 
                      identify and name noncongruent partitions within a rectangle.  Students reason about the relative 
                      size of different areas within the whole playground.  They use relationships of the partitions to 
                      determine the size of each area (e.g., one area is ½ of the size of another area which is &frac14;th of 
                      the whole playground. Therefore,  it is &#x215B;th of the whole playground).  Students could use 
                      “reasoning up” by determining how many of one size area it would take to make the whole playground.</p>

                      <p>Lesson 9, “Using a Number Line” continues students’ work with number lines as a tool/representation 
                      for problem solving.  In this lesson students create and use a number line to add two fractions with 
                      unlike denominators.  Students need experiences constructing number lines and using them to add and 
                      subtract fractions with like denominators and equivalent fractions (e.g., &#x2153; + 4/6) before using the 
                      number line to represent addition of fractions with unlike denominators. Students see that they can 
                      partition any interval on a number line into smaller equal intervals thus locating other fractions. 
                      Finding the location of the sum with jumps of different units (e.g., halves and thirds) is facilitated 
                      by partitioning each unit into an equivalent unit, (e.g., halves are partitioned into three sections and 
                      thirds into two sections resulting in both having sixths as their unit).</p>

                      <p>In Lesson 10, “Unit Multiplication on a Number Line”  students represent the action of multiplying a 
                      whole number by a fraction and a fraction by a whole number on a number line.  Students relate 
                      multiplication of fractions to multiplication of whole numbers.  They demonstrate that even though 
                      multiplication of fractions is commutative, the size and number of iterations along a number line changes 
                      according to the role the factors play (multiplier-number of iterations or multiplicand-size of the 
                      iterations).  Visualizing this action on a number line leads to a deeper understanding of the role of the 
                      multiplier and multiplicand in fractions multiplication.  Modeling multiplication of a fraction by a whole 
                      number on a number line facilitates an understanding of why multiplication by a fraction involves the act 
                      of dividing (&#x2155; of 20 is &#x2155; &#x00D7; 20 but actually involves dividing by 5 (into fifths)). This facilitates 
                      students’ understanding of what the factors and solution in real world problems involving fractions 
                      represent.</p>

                      <h2>Differentiating Lessons</h2>

                      <p>To differentiate problem solving tasks and meet the needs of all students choose different number sets or change the 
                      structure of the problem. The provided lessons have suggested variations of number choices and levels of difficulty. 
                      These choices are based upon a continuum of students’ understanding of fractional amounts. The continuum of 
                      understanding of fractional amounts may start with one-half, one-fourth and one-third. A possible (not exhaustive) 
                      progression is one-eighth, one-sixth, one-tenth, three-fourths, and two-thirds, based upon the students’ prior 
                      experiences.</p>

                      <p>Students build on their experiences through a variety of problems increasing in difficulty.  It is important to 
                      provide these experiences for our students to develop and deepen their conceptual understanding before we introduce 
                      <i>only</i> generalizations with symbolic notation.</p>
