                        <h1>Creating a Classroom Culture</h1>
                    </div>

                    <p>The mathematical practices describe what mathematically proficient students are able 
                    to do. To develop students’ efficiency with the mathematical practices, it is essential 
                    to create a productive classroom culture that incorporates problem solving.  The key to 
                    a productive culture of problem solving is that the students are the selectors, strategizers, 
                    thinkers, and presenters.  In short the students do the work.  They persevere through 
                    difficult problems. They select the tools that will facilitate their understanding and help 
                    them work through the problem.  They determine the strategy or approach to the problem that 
                    makes sense to them. They record and share their thinking in a way that others are able to 
                    follow and understand.  They listen to and critique the reasoning of others and reflect on 
                    their own strategy in relationship to other students’ strategies. </p>

                    <p>As students work on a task, the teacher observes and questions students to help them 
                    focus on the problem, to uncover the student’s thinking and to prompt students to extend 
                    their thinking and deepen their understanding.  Through this observation and questioning the 
                    teacher has a better idea of the various levels of understanding in the class.  The teacher 
                    selects and sequences student work to facilitate students making connections between various 
                    solution strategies, including addressing misconceptions.</p>

                    <p>Create a community that is a safe place to take healthy risks.  It is O.K. to take a risk 
                    and to make mistakes.  Mistakes are learning opportunities.  Answers still matter though the 
                    goal of any lesson is to facilitate surfacing of the mathematics and avoid focusing on just 
                    the answer. The learning takes place when we view it as a process of revision.  Deep learning 
                    occurs when we struggle and get immediate feedback from our mistakes. A difficult problem 
                    should create a sense of disequilibrium.  When students feel that they are capable 
                    mathematicians, they take the risk and accept the challenge as a learning opportunity.  </p>

                    <h2>Selecting Problems</h2>

                    <p>The first step in creating a problem solving classroom culture is to select problems 
                    that require students to deepen their understanding and increase their ability to do the 
                    math. Rich problems will make students stretch beyond their present understanding.  They 
                    require productive struggle and a state of disequilibrium. Students will view solving 
                    problems as a learning process which will require extended thinking, struggle, perseverance 
                    and effort. They will see themselves as mathematical doers and thinkers.</p>

                    <p>Select problems that have multiple entry points and elicit a variety of solution strategies 
                    from direct modeling to relational thinking. Every student needs to have an entry point and be 
                    able to access the content. Some examples of multiple entry points are the context of the problem 
                    makes sense and is of interest to the students. Tools (e.g., color tiles, paper strips, Cuisenaire 
                    rods) are available to support direct modeling of the problem . The problem connects to 
                    mathematics students have experienced before. They may need to apply it in a different way. There 
                    is some prior knowledge they can apply to support solving a new problem. The content can be 
                    differentiated by choosing appropriate number choices for different students within your class and 
                    scaffolding the lessons. One way to scaffold these lessons with students who are experiencing  
                    difficulty devising a solution strategy is to ask them to act out the actions within the problem.</p>

                    <p>Plan for students who have easy access to the mathematics, to stretch and go beyond the core 
                    mathematics of the problem. You may change the structure of the problem, give them more difficult 
                    numbers or prompt students to go deeper in their explanation of the mathematics and to make 
                    connections to other mathematical concepts. If problems are flexible enough to allow for multiple 
                    approaches and multiple abilities, all students will have access to learning from the mathematical 
                    content within a problem (e.g., “Feeding Brody” has different and multiple number choices, 
                    “Estimating on a Number Line” has different fraction choices for students to compare).</p>

                    <h2>Productive Struggle</h2>

                    <p>Mathematically proficient students <i>make sense of problems and persevere in solving 
                    them (MP1).</i> Often when students face struggle for the first time, they feel that they 
                    cannot do math or that the task is beyond their capabilities.  Assure students that 
                    struggle is productive and necessary for learning to occur.  Celebrate the 
                    satisfaction and accomplishment of a productive work session. A problem based approach 
                    to teaching focuses on teaching for understanding. The focus is on the process not the 
                    answer.  The answer is part of the process.  Some students may not complete a problem 
                    or come to a full understanding of a concept.  Help these students realize what they 
                    have learned and what they need to work on so that all students gain a deeper 
                    understanding of a concept. Every student may not leave a problem solving lesson with 
                    the same level of understanding.  However, every student will experience growth based 
                    on their previous level of understanding.</p>

                    <h2>Use of tools</h2>

                    <p>The Common Core State Standards Mathematics Practice 5 calls for students to <i>Use 
                    appropriate tools strategically.</i>  The tool may be paper and pencil, various manipulatives 
                    or technology. The students must select the available tools appropriate for the task.  
                    The key is that the tool is useful for representing the concept or solving the problem.  
                    Tools allow us to model a problem, see it from a different perspective, represent it in 
                    ways that make sense and show us relationships we otherwise would not see. </p>

                    <p>A routine for selecting and using the appropriate tools for a task needs to be 
                    established.  Students unfamiliar with certain tools, such as Cuisenaire rods, may not 
                    know how they can be used to represent a concept. When a new tool is introduced to the 
                    classroom, give students an exploration experience when they can discover the possible 
                    uses for the tool.  This will take place before the tool is offered for problem solving. 
                    Have students discuss what they notice about unfamiliar manipulatives.  The manipulatives’ 
                    useful properties should surface during the discussion.  However, do not limit students 
                    to what you think is the tool’s best use. </p>

                    <p>Using tools will help students make sense of problems which otherwise may be beyond 
                    their reach.  Tools can support a concrete representation of abstract concepts.  How 
                    students move to more efficient use of tools or away from concrete representations will 
                    vary depending on the student.  During whole group discussions, students observe others 
                    using a variety of tools and more efficient strategies.  They discuss and make sense of 
                    how the tools are used to represent or make sense of a problem. When they are ready, they 
                    move away from the concrete representations with the tools to adopt more efficient, 
                    abstract strategies, such as mental strategies or algorithms.  This happens after students 
                    have developed a solid conceptual understanding of the content.  However, when students 
                    are faced with more complex content they may choose to use concrete representations to 
                    help them understand and solve a problem.</p>

                    <p>As the students work, watch for students who switch the tool they are using; discuss 
                    why they switched and use the discussion to help other students realize the purpose of the 
                    tool is to help them understand and work through a problem.  If the tool is not useful, 
                    then they abandon it and try another strategy.</p>

                    <h2>Student strategies</h2>

                    <p>Mathematically proficient students <i>Model with mathematics (MP4)</i>. They are
                    able to <i>apply the mathematics they know</i> to help them solve problems. Through the
                    process of solving a problem students use what they know to develop and revise
                    strategies appropriate to the problem.</p>

                    <p>The key for students to develop efficient strategies for problem solving is that
                    they encounter a problem and work through it using whatever strategy makes sense to
                    them. If a teacher presents a strategy, students tend to accept the strategy as “the
                    way” without further reflection or sense making. This often leads to confusion and a
                    lack of transference. After students have grappled with a problem, they listen to other
                    students present their thinking and reflect on their own thinking in relationship with
                    other student’s strategy. They make connections. They agree or disagree. They question
                    and accept or reject strategies.</p>

                    <p>When selecting student work to share during whole class discussions, one option is
                    to select work that progresses in the sophistication of the strategy (e.g., from
                    concrete to abstract). This allows students to see a progression and gives some
                    students access to a strategy that is more efficient than their strategy.</p>

                    <h2>Share out</h2>

                    <p>Mathematically proficient students <i>construct viable arguments and critique the
                    reasoning of others (MP3)</i>. During a whole class share out, students are able to 
                    present their constructed solutions.  They must prove their solution works. Other 
                    students listen to their classmates and determine if their classmates’ solutions make 
                    sense.  They question their classmates to gain a better understanding and to improve 
                    the presenter’s argument. </p>

                    <p>The classroom must be a safe environment for students to share their thinking and 
                    confusions.  They must feel safe to share their thinking even if it is wrong.  When 
                    students understand everyone makes mistakes and their mistakes are not unique, they 
                    take pride in the learning environment which is established through sharing 
                    misconceptions and errors along with successes. Misconceptions and errors may reveal 
                    a misunderstanding of a concept or procedural mistake.  If not revealed, students may 
                    continue to be confused about a topic or carry the misconception into other concepts. 
                    Teachers can address misconceptions when students share their strategies and solutions. 
                    More sensitive students may require a one-on-one analysis of errors during the explore 
                    section.</p>

                    <p>Listeners must monitor their own understanding of the presenter’s solution.  They 
                    ask questions to clarify their understanding of the strategy. (In the beginning, 
                    teachers may ask clarifying questions to model for the students.) Students reflect on 
                    how their strategy compares to other students’ strategies.  They also determine if the 
                    presenter’s solution or methods are accurate.  They agree or disagree with the 
                    presenter and give their reasons for agreement or disagreement.</p>

                    <p>A good practice in promoting discourse among students is to have students use 
                    respectful language when they disagree with another student’s work.   Have students 
                    lead  with a statement like, “I disagree because...” Never, “You’re wrong.”  The 
                    “because…” creates a back-and-forth argument that leads to clarity and most likely 
                    agreement and deeper understanding.</p>

                    <p>One way to assure students listen to and understand another student’s strategy is 
                    to ask students to solve a similar problem or situation using that student’s strategy 
                    and share how they applied that strategy. Another way is for students to restate or 
                    rephrase a student’s strategy. During the whole class sharing the goal is to help 
                    students make connections between their own thinking and other students’ thinking, to 
                    move them forward in their mathematical knowledge, to attain the goals of the lesson, 
                    to help students question, critique, wonder, and advance their own thinking.</p>

                    <p>The end goal in teaching children to become mathematically proficient students is 
                    that they are able to solve real problems.  They are able to approach a problem with 
                    confidence.  In short, that they are able to move forward without us.</p>
