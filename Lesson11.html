                      <p>Scale Fractions Addition and Subtraction asks students to compute the
                      sum or difference of the given bar model and plot the answer on the number
                      line. The bars move to the number line and show the action of adding or
                      subtracting the second model to or from the first model. This game connects
                      the bar model to a number line by defining the distance from zero to 1 (the
                      unit whole) using a whole bar and demonstrating the action of adding or
                      subtracting mixed numbers represented by the bars.</p>

                                  put the bars for the first number on the number line. Then I

                                  the answer. It didn’t matter how I put the bars on the number
                                  line. They still end up at the same place. For the subtraction
                                  problem, I put the strips for the first number on. I laid the
                                  strips for the second number on top of the first number and
                                  took away those strips that matched up. I didn’t have enough of
                                  the fourths, so I traded the whole for four fourths and took
                                  away as many as I had left from the second number.”</li>

                          subtraction with jumps along the number line. Compare this with the bar

                          the subtrahend and they justify their decomposition.</li>
