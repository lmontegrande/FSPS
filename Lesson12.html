                      <p>Scale Fractions Addition and Subtraction L.I. asks us to compute the sum
                      or difference of the given expression and place the yellow ball on the
                      number line to indicate the answer. The numerals in the expression turn
                      into a bar model, move to the number line and show the action of adding or
                      subtracting. This game connects the bar model to a number line by defining
                      the distance from zero to 1 (the unit whole) using a whole bar and
                      demonstrating the action of adding or subtracting mixed numbers represented
                      by the bars. The animation demonstrates a strategy for adding and
                      subtracting mixed numbers by decomposing them into a whole number and
                      fraction.</p>

                      decomposing a whole number into an equivalent fraction or a mixed number
                      into an improper fraction. How could this problem be modeled on the number

                          <li>Students make connections among the numerals and operations,
                          bar/drawing models and the number line model. Connect back to the JiJi

                                  like when a whole bar on the puzzle was lifted away.</li>

                                  <li>I added all of the whole numbers first. That is like when
                                  all of the whole bars on the puzzle came down first and moved
                                  to the right on the number line. I showed this with jumps to
