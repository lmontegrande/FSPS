            <h2>ST Math Game:</h2>
            <p>In Fruit Monster, the goal is to feed the correct number of monsters using
              exactly the right amount of fruit given the rate each monster eats fruit
              to help JiJi cross the grass. The multiplicative relationship between these
              three quantities helps build an understanding of the inverse relationship
              between multiplication and division. Some levels give the rate monsters
              eat fruit (4 apples per monster) and the total number of monsters to be
              fed (3 monsters,) and ask ‘How many apples do you need to feed all the
              monsters? (3 groups of 4 equals 12 or 3 x 4 = 12.) This equal groups problem
              represents one model of multiplication. However, given the same rate, if
              the known is the total fruit available and the unknown changes to the number
              of monsters to be fed we have a very different problem. This puzzle now
              asks, ‘If each monster eats 4 apples, how many monsters can you feed with
              12 apples?’ What was a equal groups multiplication problem now can be seen
              as a measurement division problem, ‘How many groups can you make with 12
              apples if each group has 4 apples?’ Using measurement division problems
              helps students build conceptual understanding of division with fractions.</p>

              variables being the size of each group (rate) and the total amount of fruit
              to be shared. The unknown variable is the number of monsters or sharers
              needed. This creates a measurement division problem with whole numbers.
              Children’s understanding of how to solve measurement division problems
              with whole numbers provides a foundation for solving problems with a fractional
              amount for the size of each group.</p>
