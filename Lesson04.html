            <h2>ST Math Game:</h2>
            <p>Scale Fractions is a game that helps players connect a bar model to a
              number line model by defining the distance from 0 to 1 (the unit whole)
              using the length of the whole bar. The goal of the game is to place the
              yellow ball on the number line so that when all the bars are laid end to
              end they reach the yellow ball. The end of the last bar has a claw that
              grabs the yellow ball and moves the number line up so JiJi can cross. The
              ball drops to block JiJi if incorrectly placed. In levels 4 and 5, students
              need to select the appropriate number of partitions from 0 to 1 to indicate
              the fraction represented in the bars. The animation shows the inverse relationship
              between number of partitions and their relative value, the more partitions
              the smaller the interval.</p>

              <p>Fractions like whole numbers are a directed location on a number line.
                Developing initial concepts of fractions as numbers occurs when encountering
                fractions as units of measure or as intervals on a number line. Actively
                constructing a number line by creating a unit whole and equal shares, then
                iterating them beyond 1 whole, provides students with a better understanding
                of why points on a number line, and their distance from 0, represent numbers.
                Discussing points on the number line (

                cover whole number distances and fractions measure out the distance between

                <b>Level 4:</b>&nbsp;Puzzles now require the user to partition the number
                line unit whole into equal lengths to match the bar model. Partitions within
                the unit whole are labeled with the corresponding denominator showing the
                role of denominator as a divisor. Students should notice that as the number
                of partitions increases (the denominator gets bigger), the size of each
                piece decreases. This inverse relationship is a key outcome for early fraction
                concepts. The unit whole is clearly defined with a blue rectangle. After
                the number of sections is selected, the blue rectangle (unit whole) slides
                along the rest of the number line and partitions it into fractions of that
                size. Students select the appropriate endpoint as they did in the previous

                  <li>What do you see in this puzzle? (Ask students to pair share at least 3
                    things they notice.)</li>
                  <li>How does the animation show... (e.g., for Levels 1-3 the act of placing
                    the numbers on the number line to select a point and the bar and the point
                    represent a number)?</li>
                  <li>How is the number line partitioned and labeled in Levels 1-3? Does this
                    change in different puzzles? Why?</li>
                  <li>How would you compare the whole bar of the bar model to the number line?
                    (The length/height of the bar model is equal to the distance from 0 to
                    1 or 1 to 2.)</li>
                  <li>How does the number that appears when you move the ball, relate to the
                    number line? (Level 2)</li>
                  <li>How else might the bars be placed on the number line? Does this change
                    the endpoint? Explain?</li>
                  <li>What happens to the size of the bar as it comes down to the number line?
                    Does that change the value? (Note: This is a perspective issue. The bars
                    in the sky are closer and therefore appear bigger. The whole bar represents
                    the interval from 0 to 1, not a specific length of an object.)</li>
                  <li>Discuss with a partner what you notice as the cursor is moved in right
                    to left and back between 0 and 1. Why do you think this happens? Where
                    should we click and why? (Level 4 and 5)</li>
                  <li>What happens to the denominator and number of sections as we move the
                    cursor to the left from 1 to 0 in Level 4?</li>
                  <li>What can you tell us about fourths, sixteenths, fifths, and twenty-eighths?</li>

                  <h4>Identify what you want students to take away from the discussion.</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Students count beyond 1 along the number line by unit fractions, e.g.
                      <sup>1</sup>⁄
                      <sub>4</sub>,
                      <sup>2</sup>⁄
                      <sub>4</sub>,
                      <sup>3</sup>⁄
                      <sub>4</sub>,
                      <sup>4</sup>⁄
                      <sub>4</sub>,
                      <sup>5</sup>⁄
                      <sub>4</sub>,
                      <sup>6</sup>⁄
                      <sub>4</sub>…</li>
                    <li>When appropriate, students use addition or multiplication equations to
                      discuss location of numbers on the number line (e.g., <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; is 5 one-fourths
                      from 0, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; + <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; + <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; + <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; + <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; = 
                      <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>, or 5 × <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; = 5/4).</li>
                    <li>Students understand that two separate number lines could use bar models
                      with different size wholes. You can show all real numbers on each one because
                      the unit whole defines where other numbers need to be placed (e.g., <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;
                      is the midpoint between 1 and 2).</li>
                    <li>Students may choose to start their number line at any number. However,
                      they need to understand that when creating a number line with their connecting
                      cubes, s, or paper strips they need to place their whole bar at 0 (or their
                      selected number) on the left end and mark the right end 1 (or the distance
                      of 1 from the left end of the bar). For example: a student starts their
                      number line at 2, the left end of the whole bar is placed at the 2 hash
                      mark and 3 is marked at the right end of the bar.</li>
                    <li>Students understand that when they divide a number line into halves each
                      iterated half is one more than the one to the left of it and that one-half
                      to the right of 2 is 2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>, etc.</li>
                    <li>Students understand that two different number lines do not have to have
                      the same distance between 0 and 1. However, on one number line the distance
                      from 0 to 1 must be the same as the distance from 5 to 6.</li>
